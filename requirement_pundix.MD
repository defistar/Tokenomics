You will need to:
- put an initial supply of 1,000,000 tokens
- add a mint function and mint another 1,000,000 tokens using this function
- add a token burn function and burn 500,000 token by sending tokens into this function
- create a lock function. eg: send your tokens to an address (wallet A) from the contract address / token owner. You can lock wallet A, so wallet A cannot move the tokens.

For mint, burn and lock function, please execute it in a smart contract. Once you are done, kindly share the token address and any smart contract address, if any.
